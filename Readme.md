## For the job opportunity and MD degree in China

For that i am not planning to continue to be a doctor in China, which is thought to be unacceptable and redicilous based on the theroy of my relatives and friends. HOWEVER, TO BE FRANK, IN MY OPITION, it is more meanging to follow your own heart instead of living a life according others' opinions, which usually determined which is right and which is wrong.



We've lived in a period that dozens of choice for job come across to us in a whole bunches. So in this case we ususally can not have the determination to choose which is the best due to the limination of our sight. however, we need to fight, to conquer, to go abord to chase your dream and board your horizen, which would be helpful, at least can not much more worse than now. We are not weak, what we suffered made us stronger.
