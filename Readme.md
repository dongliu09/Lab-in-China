## For the job opportunity and MD degree in China

For that i am not planning to continue to be a doctor in China, which is thought to be unacceptable and redicilous based on the theroy of my relatives and friends. HOWEVER, TO BE FRANK, IN MY OPITION, it is more meanging to follow your own heart instead of living a life according others' opinions, which usually determined which is right and which is wrong.



We've lived in a period that dozens of choice for job come across to us in a whole bunches. So in this case we ususally can not have the determination to choose which is the best due to the limination of our sight. however, we need to fight, to conquer, to go abord to chase your dream and board your horizen, which would be helpful, at least can not much more worse than now. We are not weak, what we suffered made us stronger.

YOU ARE NO LONGER AT THE EDGE, DONG

Yeah, no longer at the edge. Since the way you have chosen, to be sure, learning how to code is great thing. Have the courage to change yourselves you need to grasp novel things and absorb them asap. Living aborad is tons of treasure you should. The people you meet. the personality you have encountered. should have some impact on youself. Now you choose to live in a brand new country, have the faith to hunt there and do whatever you want to do. Dont be afraid to change, baby.

Viva La vida
